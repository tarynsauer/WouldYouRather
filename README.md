# Would You Rather Project

This React/Redux app was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). It was submitted for the second final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. It allows users to answer create "Would you rather"-style poll questions and submit answers to other users' questions. It also has a dashboard to track each users' total question and answer counts.

## Getting Started

To start the app:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

### TODOs
* add tests
* swap out the dummy backend server with real API calls
